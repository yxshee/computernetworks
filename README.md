- [Network Components](./code/NetworkComponents/) - Detailed information about hardware and software networking components

### Router Configurations
- [Router Initial Config](./code/RouterInitialConfig/) - Basic router setup, passwords, and SSH configuration
- [Static Route Config](./code/StaticRouteConfig/) - Static routing between networks
- [RIPv2 Config](./code/RIPv2Config/) - RIP version 2 dynamic routing protocol configuration
- [OSPF Config](./code/OSPFConfig/) - OSPF dynamic routing protocol configuration

### Network Addressing & Services
- [Subnetting and VPC](./code/SubnettingAndVPC/) - Subnet calculations and Virtual PC configuration
- [DHCP Pool Config](./code/DHCPPoolConfig/) - DHCP server pool configuration

### Network Protocols & Topologies
- [ARP and Topologies](./code/ARPandTopologies/) - ARP protocol demonstration and network topologies
- [Networking Commands](./code/NetworkingCommands/) - Common networking commands reference

## üîß How to Use This Repository

Each folder contains:
1. A `README.md` describing the specific topic
2. A text file with detailed commands, configurations, or explanations

To practice these concepts:
- Use network simulation tools like GNS3, Packet Tracer, or EVE-NG
- Try the commands in a virtual lab environment
- Implement the configurations on actual network devices for hands-on learning

## üìã Topics Covered

- Network fundamentals and concepts
- OSI and TCP/IP models
- Network types and topologies
- Router and switch configurations
- Routing protocols (Static, RIP, OSPF)
- Subnetting and IP addressing
- DHCP configuration
- Network security basics
- Command-line tools and utilities
