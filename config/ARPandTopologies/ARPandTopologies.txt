1) ARP Protocol demonstration:
   - Use Wireshark on a live network; filter 'arp' to observe ARP request/reply frames.
   - Trigger ARP by pinging a new IP on the same subnet.

2) Topologies commands/practice:
   - Point-to-point PC to PC: no configurationâ€”direct link.
   - PC to Router: configure PC IP, subnet, gateway; configure router interface IP.
   - PC-to-PC-via-switch: connect both to switch; configure IPs and gateways.
   - Bus topology: simulated via hub in GNS3.
   - Ring topology: simulated via switch loopback/link simulator.
   - Tree topology: combine star segments hierarchically.
